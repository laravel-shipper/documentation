## Legal Pages

Legal pages are created by default when you install the Laravel Shipper pacakage.

You can find both routes in `routes/web.php`.

Also, you can find and change your legal address, and email in the `config/shipper.php` under `legal.address`, and `legal.email`.

Both templates are inside the `views/pages` directory.
