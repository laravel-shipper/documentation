### 1. Set Up Payments

### 2. Create Products

### 3. No free account / Force user payment or subscription

By default any user can create an app an access the dasboard, but this is something you can change with a single line.

Laravel Shipper includes a `ProductPurchased` middleware who will check theat the user has at least one subscription or product purchase. If not, he will be redirected to `/dashboard/subscribe` to choose a plan or product.

To use this middleware in your dashboard route, you just need to add it to the middleware array like this:

```php
use Lss\Http\Middleware\ProductPurchased;

// â€¦

Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    return view('dashboard');
})->middleware(['auth', 'verified', ProductPurchased::class])->name('dashboard');
```

This is the dasboard when the user needs a subscription or purchase and has none.
